Diagram: The high-level architecture of StreamGlass. This diagram shows how the web browser clients (running the StreamGlass front-end UI) connect over the internet to a central Socket.IO server, which in turn connects to the Electron-based desktop app running on the streamerâ€™s PC. The Socket.IO server acts as a real-time relay between the browser and desktop, enabling users to control your workstation with any device, from anywhereâ€‹.
In practice, multiple browser clients can connect to the central server, and each streamerâ€™s desktop app also maintains a persistent Socket.IO connection to that server. This design decouples the UI from the local machine control, with the server brokering messages between themâ€‹.
